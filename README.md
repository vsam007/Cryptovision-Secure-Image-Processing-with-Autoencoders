# Cryptovision: Secure Image Processing with Autoencoders

**Description**:
Developed an innovative image encryption and decryption system using autoencoders, as part of a project titled "Hybrid Encryption Scheme for Medical Imaging Using AutoEncoder and Advanced Encryption Standard." This project aims to enhance the security of medical imaging data through a hybrid approach combining the strengths of autoencoders and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Designed and implemented an autoencoder-based neural network for secure image encryption and decryption.
- Integrated AES to further strengthen the encryption mechanism, ensuring robust security for medical imaging data.
- Preprocessed and managed datasets, facilitating effective training and testing of the model.
- Conducted extensive model training, optimization, and validation to achieve high accuracy and security standards.
- Documented the entire workflow and results in a detailed Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating the efficacy of the hybrid encryption scheme.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python, PyTorch for neural network development
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and documentation
- AES for encryption integration
- GitHub for version control and project collaboration

**Impact**:
- Enhanced the security protocols for medical imaging data, addressing critical privacy concerns.
- Demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of combining autoencoders with traditional encryption methods for secure image processing.
